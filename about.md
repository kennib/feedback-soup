This is a blog about complex systems.
It's about the connections, interactions and feedback loops between individual entities that make up a whole.

The posts are written by me, Kenni Bawden.
I'm a Master of Complex Systems student at University of Sydney with a life long term interest in society, information visualisation and learning how things work.
