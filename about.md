This is a blog about complex systems.
It's about the interactions between individual, interacting entities that make up a whole and the emergent phenomena that arise within them.


The title, *k-clique* bait is a play on the phrase *click bait* and the network analysis concept of *k-cliques*.
A *k-clique* is a group with a number (*k*) of individuals that all have a direct relationship with each other.
The logo is a letter k made of 5 k-cliques where *k* is 6.

The posts are written by me, Kenni Bawden.
I'm a Master of Complex Systems student at University of Sydney with a life long term interest in society, information visualisation and learning how things work.
